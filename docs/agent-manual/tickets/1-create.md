# Creating Tickets

## Standard Procedure

Under normal circumstances, you won't need to create tickets manually. Our AI-powered Remote Intelligent Expert System (AIRES) handles this process automatically for all IT support issues. AIRES creates the ticket, assigns it to itself, and closes it once the issue is resolved.

## Manual Ticket Creation

There are, however, special situations where you might need to create tickets manually:

1. If AIRES is temporarily unavailable
2. When handling an escalated call that requires a new ticket

In these cases, you can use the Agent Interface to create a ticket. Look for the green (ðŸŸ¢) + icon in the bottom left corner of your interface.

## Understanding the Ticket Creation Form

The ticket creation form contains fields configured by your System Administrator. To create a ticket:

1. Fill out all required fields in the form
2. Click the green (ðŸŸ¢) "Create" button

### Special Fields

While most fields are self-explanatory, there are two fields that AIRES uses which you don't need to interact with:

1. **AI THREAD**: This is the ID of the conversation associated with the ticket. AIRES uses this to retrieve the correct context of the user's issue.

2. **AI CALL ID**: This field stores the ID of the call associated with the ticket.

These fields are automatically populated by the system and don't require your input or modification.

## Best Practices for Manual Ticket Creation

When creating tickets manually, keep these tips in mind:

1. Be as detailed as possible in describing the issue
2. Use clear and concise language to ensure easy understanding for other agents who might handle the ticket later
3. If creating a ticket for an escalated call, make sure to note any previous interactions or ticket numbers related to the issue

Remember, manual ticket creation should be the exception rather than the rule. Always rely on AIRES for standard ticket creation unless special circumstances require your intervention.
